### VARS DEFAULTS
### The following are defaults for files managed by chsec.
### They should not be set directly by role users. If you really
### need to override them, use the corresponding, unprefixed variables (eg
### `chsec_managed_files` to override __chsec_managed_files).

### USER OPTIONS
# Blank initial list for 'chsec' yaml
__chsec: []

# Set to False to disable this role completely
__chsec_enable: True

# If the below is true, create a backup of the config files before making changes
__chsec_backup: False
__chsec_backupdir: '/tmp/'

# Don't apply OS defaults when set to true
#NOTIMP: __chsec_skip_defaults: true

# Deploy new templates before running chsec commands
#NOTIMP: __chsec_use_templates: false

# If the below is false, don't reload daemons on change
#NOTIMP: __chsec_allow_reload: false

__chsec_command: /usr/bin/chsec
__lssec_command: /usr/bin/lssec

### The official ibm documentation for AIX 7.2 lists /etc/security/group 
### twice and doesnt list all of these in both lists.  This an exhaustive
### merger of IBM's two lists.
